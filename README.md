I have created a weather dashboard where you can search any city and find the 5 day forecast.

In the html file you will find the basic layout for the site. You will also find the links to the outside sources i used to create the site. Since there was not much styling that needed to be made on this project. I did most of it right in the html.

In the script file you will find the functionality for the site. You will find the api key and the link to the openweathermap site that was used to generate the 5 day forecast. I also made it possible to store the search history for the latest searched cities.
